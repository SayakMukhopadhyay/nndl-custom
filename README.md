# Updated and modified code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains updated code samples for the
e-book ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen. The code has
been updated to be used by Python 3.11 and the code has been refactored slightly to make it more understandable.

The code also includes the algorithm to read and pickle the original MNIST dataset, which has been included in the
repository in the [/data](/data) folder. The code can also be used to generate the 28x28 pixel images present in the
original dataset. The images will be saved in the [/data/images](/data/images) folder.
